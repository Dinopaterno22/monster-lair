            -----------------------------------------------------------
            SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
            -----------------------------------------------------------

            PREAMBLE
            The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
            development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
            efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
            open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
            with others.

            The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
            redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
            fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
            redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
            names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
            however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
            requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
            to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

            DEFINITIONS
            "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
            Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
            include source files, build scripts and documentation.

            "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
            copyright statement(s).

            "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
            distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

            "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
            or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
            Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
            new environment.

            "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
            writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

            PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
            Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
            a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
            redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
            Software, subject to the following conditions:

            1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
            in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

            2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
            redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
            contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
            included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
            in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
            binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

            3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
            Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
            Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
            presented to the users.

            4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
            Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
            Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
            Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
            permission.

            5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
            must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
            distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
            remain under this license does not apply to any document created
            using the Font Software.

            TERMINATION
            This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
            not met.
